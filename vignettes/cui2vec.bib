  abstract      = "Word embeddings are a popular approach to unsupervised
                   learning of word relationships that are widely used in
                   natural language processing. In this article, we present a
                   new set of embeddings for medical concepts learned using an
                   extremely large collection of multimodal medical data.
                   Leaning on recent theoretical insights, we demonstrate how
                   an insurance claims database of 60 million members, a
                   collection of 20 million clinical notes, and 1.7 million
                   full text biomedical journal articles can be combined to
                   embed concepts into a common space, resulting in the largest
                   ever set of embeddings for 108,477 medical concepts. To
                   evaluate our approach, we present a new benchmark
                   methodology based on statistical power specifically designed
                   to test embeddings of medical concepts. Our approach, called
                   cui2vec, attains state of the art performance relative to
                   previous methods in most instances. Finally, we provide a
                   downloadable set of pre-trained embeddings for other
                   researchers to use, as well as an online tool for
                   interactive exploration of the cui2vec embeddings.",
